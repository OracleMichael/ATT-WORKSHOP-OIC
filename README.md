## Part 1: Connecting to ATP

This part handles the "non-optional" part of the lab. It is our objective to make sure every lab attendee is able to complete this integration.

### **Step 1: Create the ATP Connection**

First, you will need to retrieve the wallet file.
1. Log in to **cloud.oracle.com**.

4. Click the button called **DB Connection**. This will give you a pop-up wizard to download the wallet. Keep the wallet type as "Instance Wallet" and add a password for the wallet. **Remember this password, you will use it to create the connection later in this step.**

9. Perform the following:
  - **Click** the upload button (square button with up arrow) and upload the wallet file you downloaded. This should be the entire zip file.
  - For the **Wallet Password**, type the password you provided when you downloaded the wallet file.
  - For the **Database Service Username**, type "ADMIN".
  - For the **Database Service Password**, your workshop instructor will provide you with the admin password.
  - Finally, right above the security section, for the not-so-optional "Service Name (optional)" enter "atpworkshop_high".
